Really Simple Lightbox
======================

This is a really simple lightbox jquery plugin. It is intended for static websites. 

* jQuery library required (in *example.html* this is downloaded from Google Hosted Libraries).
* Plugin is 3KB minified.
* Accompanying stylesheet is 1KB minified.
* Also required: Font Awesome (or your preferred icon font) for *dismiss*, *group previous*, *group next* and *lightbox loading* icons. (In *example.html* these are downloaded from maxcdn/bootstrapcdn.com).
* Simple to use (simplest example: just add *rel="lightbox"* to an *<a>* hyperlink, and link to the large image to be shown in the lightbox).
* Demo and full instructions included in *example.html*. (Images downloaded from Placekitten.)
* Optional extra: Really Simple Grid system. Maybe useful for laying out image gallery thumbnail grids. You can use it if you are not already using a grid system in your project.
* MIT licence (Open Source).

Yes I know there are hundreds of lightbox scripts out there already. But mine may be the cutest. :-)
